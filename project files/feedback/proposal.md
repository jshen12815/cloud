### Arthur
Intriguing project. I am worried that the scope is too big. Perhaps you would want to narrow the scope of your project a bit - say, concentrate on just the gaming aspect or just the music editing aspect. I would also be interested in some implementation details for the app. What would the game experience look like? You mentioned many python audio libraries, how will you use them? Which parts require the audio processing, and will it occur in the server or at the client? Make sure all the audio processing part of the project does not interfere with you ability to focus on the web-related aspects of your project, which are the most important.

### Charlie
Overall this project is very broad, but this is perhaps appropriate for a five-person group.  Based on the group size it is important that all aspects of your project succeed, including the sound editing, games, and social networking features.  At a high level your proposed application is somewhat similar to Grumblr + sound editing + games; be sure that all members of your team contribute substantially to parts of the project that are not just Grumblr-like.

Your selection of audio-related technologies looks fine, and it seems as if the audio-related aspects of your project are currently more carefully defined than the games aspects of your project.  In its current form I am slightly concerned about the lack of detail for the game-related aspects of the project; please make sure the games aspect of the project specification is much better developed than in the project proposal.  

For a project of this size---and with several distinct components---you will certainly experience some integration problems as you work.  You might find it difficult to turn in a cohesive project with uniform high-quality and uniform design.  You should plan very early---from now, the beginning of the project---for how your team will work and continuously integrate your work as the semester progresses.  To be successful, I think, your project group will need to finish the separate componets of your project well before the project deadlines so that you have time to fully integrate (and debug integration problems as they arise) your work before each deadline.

### Salem
Sounds a bit like Grumblr, but providing an interface to upload, edit, record, and play music is no small feat. On top of this, games are huge things in and of themselves. It may be a bit too ambitions to tackle both, unless you're confident you can manage the work between the five of you (not an unheard of task). It may be better to divide the music editing and recording task into components, or the game into components, to make one solid feature. 

### Shannon
This is a very sizable project. I think that this would be acomplishable if you dropped some features, notably games. It's very unclear what 'games' actually consists of so I would only advise adding it back in if it is absolutely defined. Make sure that the music editing and music-related features are definitely completed, or otherwise this project could be in danger of being too similar to Grumblr.
