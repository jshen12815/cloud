Project Spec Feedback
=====================

### Product Backlog (10/10)
  * The features are well spec'd out, but I'm a little unsure about how the actual music editing is going to work. Are these chagnes being applied in real-time to a track? Are the effects being added to the entirety of the song, and if so, are you tracking changes? Some effects are destructive and can't just be applied to a song without losing data (i.e. if I kill the lows on a track, I am essentially deleting that data). 

### Data Models (10/10)
  * Barring the question of effects above, the data models look fine. 

### Wireframes or Mock-ups (9/10)
  * -1, I'm not sure how any of the music related features are represented. 

### Sprint 1 Planning (9.9/10)
  * -0.1, Your backlog looks good, but your plan doesn't seem to specify a Product Owner for the sprint.
